What was your overall approach to tackling this project?
The main thing was that we did was that we started coding as we were thinking of the project and our next steps. This has caused issues such us realizing later that our code was not in objected oriented way.
What new thing(s) did you learn / figure out in completing this project?
The new things that I learned during this project was sorting out a hashtable by using the comparable method to check if two things are the same and sorting them out.
Is there anything that you wish you had implemented differently?
I wish we implemented our recommend method differently, because after I tried making a recommend method I noticed that it was similar to our canTake because our canTake method checks if the ArrayList passed in all contained in our classes ArrayList while the recommend would be if the ArrayList passed in is not contain inside the classes then we recommend these classes to the user. However this cause the issue that we also did something similar to this in our setTaken method inside the Major.
If you had unlimited time, what additional features would you implement?
If I had more time I would have added more methods in our schedule class, but only with the help of the professor. I thought that on Friday Jordan would have his office hours so I went there to ask for help with my recommend method that I created inside the schedule class, but there was no office hours so I just came back. I did not delete my method though I only commented it out. Also if we had more time then we would have fixed some debugging issues in our code. Our code does compile but it has few mistakes which I do not know how to fix alone with out a professor's help. When the userinputs y or n for the classes they have taken at the end when we print out the result there is an issue with classes that do ot have prereqs when the user input is no. I hope this will not mean that we failed our project we put a lot effort to have our codes work to have noticed this until the last minute.
What was the most helpful piece of feedback you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?
I one night I was at TA hours and I went to ask hel from Asher who got confused after seeing my code. She told me that my code was not object oriented and she also recommended me to go and see Jordan to better understand how to do it in object oriented way. I would forever be grateful to her, because if I did not follow her advice I might have failed my project.
If you could go back in time and give your past self some advice about this project, what hints would you give?
First thing would be to not start coding until you have a full plan of if the way we are doing the project meets the requirments. Also seek help from the professors it might happen that you would not know how to use some methods.
If you worked with a team: please comment on how your team dynamics influenced your experience working on this project.
Out of all students I did CS projects with I would say I enjoyed the moments I spent with Sarah the most. We meet couple of times and during those times we would sometimes just have fun and this really was helpful in making a healthy environment where we are not only stressed.

I just wanted to share that our code does compile on my laptop, because I am worried that we might lose points if it does not compile on your laptop.

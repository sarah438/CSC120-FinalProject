Alternate design: Creating a table for each semester to visually show the user when they would be taken required classes for the major. We phased out this idea, because we needed to shift our focus to getting the program to run and having the code to compile. Trying to create a table would have taken up a lot of time that we didn't have. We also took a long time to firgure out how to order the Hashtable and without the Hashtable being the order we wanted it to be in, we couldn't create a fancy schedule template for the user. We also wanted to print out a recommendation for the next course the user can take that they satisfy the prerequisite classes for, but we didn't have the time for that, so we just have a statement printed out if they have taken the prequisite courses for major courses that they have not taken yet.

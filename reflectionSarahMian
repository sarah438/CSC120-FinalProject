To tackle this project, we just went into starting it instead of figuring out the best plan of attack. This caused many problems in trying to get the program to 
work, since we didn't have a clear sense of what our direction would be. While working on this project, I learned how to sort a hashtable. I wish we were able 
to implement creting courses differnelty. We had to hard code the course information for each class. With more time, I would have wanted to learn how to read a 
file in java and use that to create a for loop to add each course into the Hashtable. I would have also wanted to create a recommend function that would list
out the courses the user should take in order of when they should take them.
